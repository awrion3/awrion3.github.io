## What is Journey?

“Journey” is a learning management system for educators and learners.
For those of you who don't know what a Learning Management System is, an LMS is a software that helps educators manage various courses and help learners track their learning progress.

## What will it do?

I'm new to programming, so I'll warn you in advance that this will be a long-term project. I plan to implement features such as basic user management, course management for educators, and test assessments for learners.
Additionally, as a teacher, I am interested in implementing gamification of learning to increase learning engagement.
Also, since I am interested in data analysis, I am hoping to implement training reports based on the learners' learning data.
